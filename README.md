# Flutter Packages

This repository aggregates Flutter packages and plugins that I actively use,
maintain, or customize in my own projects.

Some of these projects are original implementations, while others are forks
that have been **significantly modified** to address limitations in upstream
designs or to support more advanced use cases such as:

- Custom native integrations
- System-level behaviors
- Enhanced APIs and extended configurations

The focus is not on experimental code, but on **usable, real-world Flutter
solutions** that can be confidently integrated into production applications.

Each project is maintained independently and linked here for easier discovery
and long-term maintenance.
